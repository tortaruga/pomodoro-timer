pomodoro timer made with vanilla js for educational purposes.
it educated me greatly. for example now i understand why people use react instead.

##### features

- three default timers: a 25 minutes timer for working on a task, a 5 minutes break and a 15 minutes break;
- custom timer: you can select any duration you wish
- animated border: the border animation helps visualize how much time's left at a glance (plus it looks kinda cool);
- pause/restart the timer;
- works even if you are working on a different tab: even if the pomodoro timer page is out of focus the timer will keep going;
- notification alarm: notification sound to alert you the time's up, without you having to check and even when the window's out of focus

if there are bugs somewhere you're allowed to ridicule me, but also kindly tell me so i can try and fix them
